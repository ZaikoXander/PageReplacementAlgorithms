## Page Replacement Algorithms

This project aims to implement various page replacement algorithms. Below is a list of the algorithms included, along with their completion status:

- [x] FIFO
- [x] NRU
- [ ] Second-Chance
- [ ] Clock
- [x] MRU 
###
- [x] LRU *

*Note: LRU is an additional algorithm outside the initial scope.

Each algorithm will be implemented as a separate class with its own logic and functionality. Feel free to explore and contribute to the project!
